# Agent notes

Keep this file current: whenever a change makes anything documented here wrong or incomplete — the dev/test commands, the parity rules, the powermeter checklist, or any other guidance below — update `AGENTS.md` in the same change so the next agent inherits accurate notes.

Resolved versions live in **`uv.lock`**. Install dev dependencies the same way CI does:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

Before finishing Python changes, run (from repo root, with dev deps):

```bash
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy src/
uv run pytest
```

CI runs the same steps (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Python ↔ ESPHome parity (REQUIRED)

`esphome/components/ct002/` is a C++ mirror of the Python CT002 stack. Any change to shared behavior must land on **both** sides in the same change. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the file mapping and what has no C++ counterpart. Verify with `uv run pytest tests/components/ct002/`.

## Steering-quality evaluation (run when touching balancer behavior)

`uv run python -m astrameter.simulator.evaluation` simulates hours of
realistic household activity against the firmware-accurate battery plant and
reports reaction/oscillation/energy metrics per scenario. Each scenario is run
over several seeds (`--seeds`, default 5) **in parallel across CPU cores**, and
every metric is the mean over those seeds — so the figures are the
seed-averaged signal, not one noisy draw (use `--seeds 1` for a quick
single-seed run, and `--seed N` to set the starting seed — seeds run are
`N..N+seeds-1`). When changing `src/astrameter/ct002/balancer.py` (or anything
else in the active-control loop), capture a baseline first (`--json base.json`
on the unchanged code), re-run after the change, and compare with `--input
head.json --compare base.json`. CI runs the same suite on PR base + head (job
`steering-eval`) and posts the comparison as a sticky PR comment. The
comparison leads with an **aggregate roll-up** (per-metric mean across all
scenarios plus a one-line overall verdict — how many metrics
improved/regressed and the mean relative change), so an across-the-board
improvement or regression is visible without reading every scenario table.

## Changelog

For user-facing work on a branch, keep **one bullet under `## Next`** that summarizes the **overall** outcome of that branch. **Add** it when you first document the change; on **later iterations** on the same branch, **edit that same bullet** if the scope or wording shifts—do **not** append extra bullets for each follow-up. Skip `CHANGELOG.md` entirely when nothing users would notice changes (refactors, tests-only, etc.).

Do **not** expand `CHANGELOG.md` with every internal or tooling-only follow-up. If the branch bullet already states the high-level theme, leave it unless the **user-visible** story changes.

## Adding a powermeter

Powermeters are Python-only and have **no** C++/ESPHome counterpart (the ESPHome
component reads grid power from any native ESPHome sensor instead), so the
parity rule above does not apply here. A new powermeter still touches several
places beyond the implementation — work through **every** step below so the
config loader, web editor, config generator, and both doc sets stay in sync
(grep an existing meter, e.g. `HomeWizard`/`HOMEWIZARD`, to find all the spots):

1. **Implementation** — Add `src/astrameter/powermeter/<module>.py` with a class subclassing `Powermeter`; implement `get_powermeter_watts()` (and `wait_for_message()` only if the base default is wrong for your source).
2. **Exports** — Import and re-export the class from `src/astrameter/powermeter/__init__.py` (both the import and `__all__`).
3. **Config loader** — In `src/astrameter/config/config_loader.py`: import the class, define a `*_SECTION` string, add a `section.startswith(...)` branch in `create_powermeter()`, and a `create_*_powermeter()` factory that reads options from the section. `POWER_OFFSET` / `POWER_MULTIPLIER`, `THROTTLE_INTERVAL`, and `NETMASK` are handled globally for any section that returns a powermeter — no extra wiring unless you need something custom.
4. **Web config editor** — Register the section's typed keys in `SECTION_KEY_TYPES` in `src/astrameter/web_config.py` (use the `_pm(...)` helper, adding only the non-default field types, e.g. `password`/`boolean`/`integer`).
5. **Web config generator** — Add a `POWERMETERS` entry in `web/ts/schema.ts` (fields, `docPython`, and an `esphome` spec describing how the same source is read on an ESP32 — `kind`/`tier` plus any `haEntity`/`url1`/`lambda1`/`warn`). Run `cd web && npm run check`.
6. **ESPHome docs** — Even though there's no C++ port, document how to read the *same source* on an ESP32 in `docs/esphome-powermeters.md`: a tier section (🟢 native / 🔵 generic HTTP / 🟠 alternate via HA/Modbus/MQTT / 🔴 not yet) **and** its entry in the Contents legend. Keep it consistent with the generator's `esphome` spec from step 5.
7. **Examples, Python docs & changelog** — Add a commented example to `config.ini.example`, a subsection **and** Contents entry in `docs/powermeters.md`, the meter to the supported-source list in `README.md`, plus one **`## Next`** `CHANGELOG.md` bullet (add once, then update that bullet on follow-up iterations if needed—see **Changelog** above).
8. **Tests** — Add `src/astrameter/powermeter/<module>_test.py` and a `create_*_powermeter` factory test in `src/astrameter/config/config_loader_test.py`; run the commands above (and `cd web && npm run check`) before finishing.
